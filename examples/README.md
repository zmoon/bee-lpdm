# Example scripts

For now, these add `blpdm` to path manually (not requiring an install). This shouldn't mess anything up if `blpdm` is actually installed (see [../README.md](../README.md)). 

Hyphens are not allowed in Python module names, but these scripts are not (at this time) intended to be imported as modules by anything.
